# Depi_Graduation_Project(TripMind)
# Abstract
TripMind is a Generative AI-based travel recommendation system designed to create personalized trip plans for users based on preferences, number of travelers, budget, and trip duration. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide intelligent itineraries, recommend hotels, restaurants, and attractions, and generate complete travel plans automatically.
 

# Problem Statement
Traditional trip planning is time-consuming and fragmented across multiple platforms. Travelers often struggle to find tailored itineraries matching their interests and budgets. There is a need for an AI-driven assistant that can dynamically generate optimized travel plans

# Proposed Solution
TripMind takes user inputs (destination, budget, duration, preferences) and uses an LLM to generate detailed itineraries. A RAG pipeline connects the model to a vector database containing travel data (hotels, restaurants, attractions) to produce personalized recommendations.
